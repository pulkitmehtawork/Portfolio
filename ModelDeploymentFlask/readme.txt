In this mini project , I am going to deploy a simple regression model which will predict salary based on years of experience of an employee . 
Structure:
salary.csv - Data with years of experience & salary.
model.py - ML Training code 
server.py - This code will use Flask web framework to handle POST requests
request.py - This is the code to make sample requests to the server .


Credits goes to below medium article which beautifully explains the whole process.
