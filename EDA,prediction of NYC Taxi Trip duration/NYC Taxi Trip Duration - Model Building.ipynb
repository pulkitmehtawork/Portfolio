In most cases they are a comfortable method for door-to-door transport. Usually they are cheaper than using licensed taxicabs. Examples of ride hailing services include Uber and Lyft.\n","\n","\n","To improve the efficiency of taxi dispatching systems for such services, it is important to be able to predict how long a driver will have his taxi occupied. If a dispatcher knew approximately when a taxi driver would be ending their current ride, they would be better able to identify which driver to assign to each pickup request.\n","\n","In this competition, we are challenged to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZHNgkaP9K9_2","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Data Dictionary\n","\n","- id - a unique identifier for each trip\n","- vendor_id - a code indicating the provider associated with the trip record\n","- pickup_datetime - date and time when the meter was engaged\n","- dropoff_datetime - date and time when the meter was disengaged\n","- passenger_count - the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value)\n","- pickup_longitude - the longitude where the meter was engaged\n","- pickup_latitude - the latitude where the meter was engaged\n","- dropoff_longitude - the longitude where the meter was disengaged\n","- dropoff_latitude - the latitude where the meter was disengaged\n","- store_and_fwd_flag - This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server (Y=store and forward;
